\chapter{Abstract}

This thesis concerns certain \emph{generalized flag manifolds}, a special kind of homogeneous spaces. In the 1950's, it was realized that generalized flag manifolds admit interesting invariant geometric structures, particularly from the point of view of complex geometry. These are traditionally investigated by means of Lie theory, leveraging the homogeneity to reduce geometric questions to algebraic ones. 

In this work, however, we take a complementary approach. We study certain examples of generalized flag manifolds, namely those which are homogeneous under the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, from a \emph{geometric} point of view. Avoiding the use of Lie theory, we study in particular the invariant almost complex structures, by differential-geometric methods. In the process, we uncover surprising connections to other topics, ranging from the existence of complex structures on the six-sphere to rigidity theorems for K\"ahler manifolds. As a main application, we use our geometric understanding to compute the Chern numbers of all invariant almost complex structures without appealing to Lie theory.
